# WatchIt
WatchIt is a custom project runner created using Node.js, Caporal and Chokidar. It can be used to monitor a project directory and run a program file such as, 'index.js' whenever anything in the project directory changes.

The project uses the following packages/libraries:
- Node.js
- Caporal: Used to build the CLI interface.
- Chokidar: Used to watch the project directory.

To use WatchIt, open a terminal and navigate to the project directory. Use either of the following commands:
- Enter 'watchit [filename]' in the terminal.
- Enter 'watchit' in the terminal. 'index.js' will be used as the program file.
